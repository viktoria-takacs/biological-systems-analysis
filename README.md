# Biological Systems Analysis

This repository contains structured analyses of selected research papers in molecular and cellular biology.

The goal is not simple translation, but deeper mechanistic understanding of how biological systems function.

---

## Focus Areas

Current thematic directions include:

- Cancer biology and cellular signaling networks  
- Tumor microenvironment dynamics  
- Bacterial gene regulation systems  
- Gene therapy and CRISPR-based mechanisms  

These topics are approached from a mechanistic and systems-oriented perspective.

---

## Structure of Each Analysis

Each paper analysis typically includes:

- Hungarian translation of key sections  
- Clarification of core biological concepts  
- Summary of experimental design  
- Interpretation of mechanistic models  
- Open conceptual and methodological questions  

---

## Central Question

Across topics, the guiding question is:

**How does this biological system actually work?**

Understanding interactions, regulatory logic, and system-level behavior is prioritized over surface-level description.

---

## Ongoing Development

This repository evolves as new papers are analyzed and conceptual connections are refined.

---

## Conceptual Themes

Recurring questions include:

- How robust are signaling networks to perturbations?
- What defines regulatory specificity in complex environments?
- How can experimental observations be abstracted into system-level models?
